# Mo'z Kubernetes reference stack
## (To automate all da things in 2018)

Using Kubernetes because...reasons (go Google).

In my opinion we always want a single store of truth (Git) that houses all we do as code.
So I set out to create a stack that declares our entire kubernetes platform, allowing to idempotently apply changes towards our desired end state without side effects.

So far I am using the following (mostly open source) technologies:

* [Kubernetes](https://github.com/Kubernetes/Kubernetes) for describing our container infrastructure.
* [Minikube](https://github.com/Kubernetes/minikube) for running a local k8s cluster
* [Helm](https://github.com/Kubernetes/helm) for packaging and deploying of Kubernetes apps and subapps.
* A bash install script to boot everything in the right order.

To boot the following Kubernetes applications/tools:

* Docker Registry for storing locally built images, and as a proxy + cache for external ones.
* [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator) + [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) + [Grafana](https://grafana.com)
* [Calico](https://github.com/projectcalico) for networking and policies k8s style.
* [ElasticSearch](www.elastic.co) + [Kibana](www.elastic.co/products/kibana) for log indexing & viewing
* [Drone](https://github.com/drone/drone) for Ci/CD, using these plugins:
    * [drone-kubernetes](https://github.com/honestbee/drone-Kubernetes) to deploy
* *DISABLED FOR NOW:* [Istio](https://github.com/istio/istio) for service mesh security, insights and other enhancements. (Waiting for SNI which enables path based vhost ingress routing).
* *COMING SOON:* [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/Kubernetes-incubator/external-dns) for making our services accesible at our FQDN

We will be going through the following workflow:

1. Configuration
2. Deploying the stack
3. Testing the apps
4. Destroying the cluster

At any point can any step be re-run to result in the same (idempotent) state.
After destroying the cluster, and then running install again, all storage endpoints will still contain the previously built/cached artifacts and configuration.
The next boot should thus be much faster :)

PREREQUISITES:

* A running Kubernetes cluster with RBAC enabled and `kubectl` installed on your local machine:
	* On OSX `bin/install.sh` will also start a minikube cluster for you.
	* If you wish to also deploy to GCE (Google Compute Engine), please create a cluster there:

		    bin/gce-create.sh

* Helm (if on osx it will detect and autoinstall)
* Forked [Morriz/nodejs-demo-api](https://github.com/Morriz/nodejs-demo-api)
* [Letsencrypt staging CA](https://letsencrypt.org/certs/fakelerootx1.pem) (click and add to your cert manager temporarily if you'd like to bypass browser warnings about https)
* In case you run minikube, for kube-lego to work (it autogenerates letsencrypt certs), make sure port 80 and 443 are portforwarded to your local machine:
	* by manipulating your firewall
	* or by tunneling a domain from [ngrok](https://ngrok.io) (and using that as `$CLUSTER_HOST` in the config below):
	    * free account: only http works since we can't load multiple tunnels (80 & 443) for one domain
	    * biz account: see provided `templates/ngrok.yaml`
* Create an app key & secret for our Drone app in GitHub/BitBucket so that drone can operate on your forked `Morriz/nodejs-api-demo` repo. Fill in those secrets in the `drone.yaml` values below.

#### 1. Configuration

Copy `secrets/*.sample.sh` to `secrets/*.sh`, and edit them.
If needed you can also edit `values/*.yaml` (see all the options in `charts/*/values.yaml`), but for a first boot I would leave them as is.

IMPORTANT: The `$CLUSTER_HOST` subdomains must all point to the main public nginx controller, which will serve all our public ingresses.

If you also want to deploy to a gce cluster, also edit these values: `values/gce/*.yaml`.

Now generate the final value files into `values/_gen` by running:

    bin/gen-values.sh

You may want to run the `bin/watch.sh` script to auto-generate these files when secrets or values are modified.

To load the aliases and functions (used throughout the stack) source them in your shell:

    . bin/aliases

#### 2. Deployment

Running the main installer with

    bin/install.sh

will do a `kubectl use-context minikube` and install the helm charts (and essential kubernetes manifests) with the values from `values/_gen/*.yaml`.

Running the main installer with

    bin/install.sh gce

will do a `kubectl use-context $KUBE_CONTEXT` and install the stack with the values from `values/_gen/gce/*.yaml`.

If on minikube, the script will also set up port forwarding to the lego node, and an ssh tunnel for the incoming traffic on your local machine.

### 3. Testing the apps

Please check if all apps are running:

    kaa

and wait...

The `api` deployment can't start because it can't find it's local docker image, which is not yet in the registry.
Drone needs to build from a commit first, which we will get to later. After that the `api:latest` tag is permanently stored in the registry's file storage,
which survives cluster deletion, and will thus be immediately used upon cluster re-creation.

When all deployments are ready the local service proxies are automatically started with:

	bin/dashboards.js

and [the service index](./docgen/minikube-service-index.html) will open.

#### 3.1 Drone CI/CD

##### 3.1.1 Configure Drone

1. Go to your public drone url (https://drone.dev.yourdoma.in) and select the repo `nodejs-demo-api`.
2. Go to the 'Secrets' menu and create the following entries (follow the comments to get the values):

        KUBERNETES_CERT= # ktf get secret $(ktf get sa drone-deploy -o jsonpath='{.secrets[].name}{"\n"}') -o jsonpath="{.data['ca\.crt']}"
        KUBERNETES_TOKEN= # ktf get secret $(ktf get sa drone-deploy -o jsonpath='{.secrets[].name}{"\n"}') -o jsonpath="{.data.token}" | base64 -D
        KUBERNETES_DNS=10.96.0.10 # if minikube
        REGISTRY=localhost:5000 # or public

##### 3.1.2 Trigger the build pipeline

1. Now commit to the forked `Morriz/nodejs-api-demo` repo and trigger a build in our Drone.
2. Drone builds and does tests
3. Drone pushes docker image artifact to our private docker registry
4. Drone updates our running k8s deployment to use the new version
5. Kubernetes detects config change and does an automated rolling update/rollback.

#### 3.2 API

Check output for the following url: https://api.dev.yourdoma.in/api/publicmethod

It should already be running ok, or it is in the process of detecting the new image and rolling out the update.

#### 3.3 Prometheus monitoring

##### 3.3.1 Grafana

Look at a pre-installed [Grafana dashboard](https://grafana.dev.yourdoma.in) showing the system cluster metrics.
Use the following default creds if not changed already in `values/grafana.yaml`:

* username: admin
* password: jaja

##### 3.3.2 Prometheus

Look at the Prometheus view to see all targets are scrapable. For now there is an issue with one endpoints cert. That will be fixed later. There will be prometheus alerts sent to the alertmanager:

##### 3.3.3 Alertmanager

The alertmanager view will show the alerts concerning the unreachable endpoints.

#### 3.4 Kibana log view

Look at a pre-installed [Kibana dashboard with Logtrail](https://kibana.dev.yourdoma.in/app/logtrail) showing the cluster logs.

Creds: Same as Grafana.

#### 3.5 Calico

Now that we have all ups running and functional, we can start deploying network policies. Let's start with denying all inbound/outbound ingress and egress for all namespaces:

	k apply -f k8s/policies/deny-all.yaml

Now we can revisit the apps and see most of them failing. Interesting observation on minikube: the main nginx-ingress is still functional. This is because current setup does not operate on the host network. To also control host networking we have to fix some things, but that will arrive in the next update of this stack (hopefully).

Let's apply all the policies needed for every namespace to open up the needed connectivity, and watch the apps work again:

	k apply -f k8s/policies

### 4. Deleting the cluster

On OSX you can delete the entire minikube cluster with

    mkd

On gcloud:

    bin/gce-delete.sh
